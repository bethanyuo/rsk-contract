# Smart Contract on RSK Node
RSK is the Smart Contract platform of Bitcoin. Its engine is a forked version of the EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), and the RVM (RSK Virtual Machine) is compatible with Ethereum Smart Contracts and the tools used to deploy and interact with them.

The `Smart Bitcoin (R-BTC)` is the native token in RSK and it is used to pay for the gas required for the execution of transactions. It is pegged 1:1 with Bitcoin, which means in RSK there are exactly 21M R-BTC. A `2-way peg (2WP)` allows the transfer of bitcoins from the Bitcoin blockchain to the RSK blockchain and vice-versa.

*	[Node](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v13.5.0/)		v13.5.0
*	NPM		v6.13.4
*	Truffle		v5.1.19		
    * ` $ npm install -g truffle@5.1.19`
*	Solc		v0.6.0

## Download and Run RSK
1.	Download _rskj-core-1.3.0-WASABI-all.jar_ on https://github.com/rsksmart/rskj/releases/tag/WASABI-1.3.0. Place it on your preferred directory. Starting now, this directory will be referred to as your workspace.

2.	Add the configuration file node.conf for RSKJ. Open up your favorite editor in the workspace and copy the contents of the following gist:
https://gist.github.com/24thsaint/85cb2d3f8c3cd7b42cf6b3d13b48ce97

3.	Open up a terminal on your workspace and run an `RSK node`. Note that you will not see any print statements on the console and it looks like the command is not responding. That is normal.
```sh
$ java -Drsk.conf.file=node.conf -cp rskj-core-1.3.0-WASABI-all.jar co.rsk.Start
```
_NOTE: Do not close this terminal nor terminate process; leave it running in the background._

## Install and Configure Truffle Project
1.	If you don’t have `truffle` and `solc` already, run the following command:
```sh
$ npm install -g truffle@5.1.19
$ npm install -g solc@0.6.0
```
You may need administrative permissions to continue with the installation.

2.	On a new terminal, initialize a truffle project and accept any prompts that may show up:
```sh
$ truffle init
```
3.	Configure _truffle-config.js_, replace it with the following content:
```js
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 4444,
      network_id: "*",
    },
  },
  compilers: {
    solc: {
      version: "0.6.0",
    },
  },
};
```
4.	Verify if you are successfully connected to RSKJ:
```sh
$ truffle console
> web3.eth.getAccounts()
```

5.	Select the default account where transactions such as contract deployment will occur by default. In this exercise, choose the first account, then add it to _truffle-config.js_.
 
## Implement and Deploy a Smart Contract
1.	To jumpstart things, use Truffle to create a contract template file for us on the correct directory:
```sh
$ truffle create contract SimpleStorage
```
This creates a _SimpleStorage.sol_ contract template file on the `contracts/` folder.

2.	Use your favorite editor to implement the `SimpleStorage` contract. Remember to use `solidity ^0.6.0`.
 

3.	Setup Migrations. Create a _2_deploy_contracts.js_ in the migrations folder with this content.

4.	With the files in place, you are now ready to deploy the smart contract. In your terminal, issue the following commands:
```sh
$ truffle compile
$ truffle migrate
```
_NOTE: It will take some time because the block where the transaction is included must be mined._

Awesome! You have successfully deployed a contract in the local RSK blockchain.
 
## Interacting with the Contract
1.	Launch a terminal in your workspace. To interact with the contract, use `truffle console`.
```sh
$ truffle console
```

2.	Then, get a reference of the deployed contract instance:
```sh
> contract = null
> SimpleStorage.deployed().then((instance) => {contract = instance})
> contract
```
3.	Retrieve the value of the data in the contract by calling the `get()` function. Remember that we had set a default value of `1234` in the contract’s constructor, so we should expect to see `1234` when retrieving the value for the first time:
```sh
> contract.get()
BN {
   negative: 0,
   words: [1234, <1 empty item> ],
   length: 1,
   red: null
}
```
 
4.	Finally, let’s set a value by calling the `set()` function and retrieving `get()` the value again afterwards to verify if we had indeed interacted with the contract:
```sh
> contract.set(5678)
> contract.get()
BN {
   negative: 0,
   words: [5678, <1 empty item> ],
   length: 1,
   red: null
}
```
Congratulations! Now, you know how to deploy smart contracts in the RSK blockchain and interact with them.
